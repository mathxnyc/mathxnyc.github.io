									<h3>Dan Viderman, Founder</h3>
									<p class="about-text">I'm a sophomore @ Brooklyn Technical High School. My first ever mathematics competition was in 6th grade when I took Mathcounts. Since then, my interest in mathematics has only increased. I’m sometimes reluctant to admit it, but math has become more than a hobby for me. I've turned it into a lifestyle. I’m even in the math major at my high school!   More recently, I’ve become a Mathcon finalist, as well as a qualifier for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, receiving 112.5 on the AMC 10. I’m in Brooklyn Tech’s math team, and I absolutely cannot wait to help everyone at MATHx reach their full potential!</p>

									<h3>Xuyuan Chen, Vice-President</h3>
									<p class="about-text"> I'm a junior @ Brooklyn Technical High School. My passion for mathematics did not start until 9th grade when I entered Brooklyn tech math team. I am really thankful for brooklyn tech’s Math team because it has provided me with an opportunity to discover my passion. So my friends and I would want to open up a summer camp to help talented math students to discover their passion in mathematics as well.</p>

									<h3>Lishore Kumar, Advanced Mathematics Teacher</h3>
									<p class="about-text">In its most general form, math allowed me to find all the ways to solve a problem, with one agreed-upon answer. Not only does MATHx  encourage unique and unorthodox solutions, but we allow you to learn them from actual competitors in the field. I first started Competition Math with an event called ‘Number Sense’, and 80-question mental math test in 10 mins with only a blue pen to write your answer. After generating a love for the sport, I continued on to competitions such as UIL, TMSCA, MathCounts, Math League, and University League math competitions. </p>

									<h3>Eric Jing, Introductory Mathematics Teacher</h3>
									<p class="about-text">I'm a freshman @ The Bronx High School of Science. Ever since I first started school, the one subject that enticed me the most was math. I found math to be the most intriguing subject due to its extreme ‘diversity’, as there are infinite ways to solve different types of problems; unlike other subjects. I first started competitive math this year (my freshman year), and some competitions I’ve attended are NYML and AMC 10. I obtain a typical 4/6 or higher on NYMLs and an 87 on the AMC 10. As an introductory math teacher, I intend to help every student reach their full potential. Looking forward to working with you!

									<h3>Vionnie Khong, Head of Marketing</h3>
									<p class="about-text">I'm a sophomore @ Bard High School Early College in Manhattan (BHSEC) and I am in charge of the marketing for MATHx. I always enjoyed reaching out to people and speaking on topics that I know quite a bit about. Math has always been a huge part of my life and everyone at MATHx will also learn to appreciate it. As a marketing and outreach coordinator, I actively seek opportunities to cater to students’ needs. If you have any questions about the camp, feel free to <a href="mailto:vi@mathx.nyc">reach out </a> and I’d be happy to respond! From the team at MATHx to you, we wish you all the best in your future endeavors and hope you consider attending!</p>
